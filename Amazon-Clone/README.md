Amazon Clone - Frontend Project Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project aims to replicate the core features of Amazon's website using only frontend technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's an excellent way to practice building responsive and interactive e-commerce web pages.

Features:
Home Page Layout:

The homepage is designed with a clean and user-friendly layout. It includes a header with search functionality, featured categories, product listings, and a footer with helpful links.
Product Cards:

Products are displayed in attractive cards with images, prices, and short descriptions. Clicking on a product leads to a detailed page.
Search Bar:

The search bar allows users to type and filter products based on keywords, improving the navigation experience.
Product Filters and Sorting:

Users can filter products based on categories, price range, and ratings. The sorting options allow sorting by popularity, price, or new arrivals.
Responsive Design:

The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
Shopping Cart:

Users can add items to their cart and see a summary of products, total price, and proceed to checkout (frontend only, no backend functionality in this project).
Interactive JavaScript Features:

JavaScript is used for functionalities such as showing/hiding product details, handling add-to-cart actions, and implementing a simple product search.
Technologies Used:
HTML: The structure of the webpage, including all elements like headers, product cards, and navigation.
CSS: Styling to make the website look like Amazon, including responsiveness and layout adjustments.
JavaScript: Interactivity such as handling search input, showing product details dynamically, and updating the cart.
Outcome:
A fully functioning frontend version of Amazon, which showcases the ability to design and develop a responsive e-commerce site. Though the project does not include backend logic or payment integrations, itâ€™s a solid start for understanding how a real-world e-commerce site might function.
